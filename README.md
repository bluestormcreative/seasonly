# Seasonly

WIP seasonal food app built on the MERN stack.

## What Is It?

A simple app that will let you:

1. find your growing zone / plant hardiness zone by zip code
2. see what's in season in your area
3. select in-season items to create a market shopping list

## Road Map and Other Ideas

- Better styles/branding overall.
- Add filters to in-season view to show only veggies, only fruit, or all items.
- Add some offline capabilities via localStorage and service workers.
- I would love to have the images update based on the zip/zone input.
- Possibly tie it into some recipe APIs?

## Built With

React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB Atlas, MUI, Vite, react-hook-form, express-session, a cast of thousands...
