# Seasonly

This project is very much WIP! -- I'm developing features with specific personal learning goals in mind, and will deploy the app once the puzzle starts coming together.

## What's It Going to Be? 
A simple app that will let you: 
1. find your growing zone / plant hardiness zone by geolocation or zip code
2. see what's in season in your area, and filter the results by either fruits or veggies (or some as-yet-to-be-determined other criteria)
3. select in-season items to create a market shopping list

## Other Ideas
- I'd love to eventually add a mapping feature to show proximity and hours for nearest farmers markets or co-ops.
- Possibly tie it into some recipe APIs? 

## Built With
React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB Atlas, MUI, react-hook-form, express-session
