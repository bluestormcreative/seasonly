# Seasonly

WIP seasonal food app built on the MERN stack.

## What Is It?

A simple app that will let you:

1. find your growing zone / plant hardiness zone by zip code
2. see what's in season in your area
3. select in-season items to create a market shopping list
4. save shopping lists

## Road Map and Other Ideas

- Allow the user to edit the most recently saved list from the in-season view.
- Better styles/branding overall.
- Add filters to in-season view to show only veggies, only fruit, or all items.
- Add some offline capabilities via localStorage and service workers.
- Larger data set, and use different images based on the zip/zone input, i.e. more "SouthWest-y" images if viewing data for zones 8/9/etc.
- Possibly tie it into some recipe APIs - pass 2-3 in-season ingredients to an API and fetch recipes that match.

## Built With
